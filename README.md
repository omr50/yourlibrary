# yourlibrary

This site allows you to enter all the books you have and add the book's info such as
name, picture, genre, price, and description. You can create a review for the book as well
and edit the book's info if you got something wrong. Full CRUD implemented and there is client
and server side validation (from bootstrap and middleware) when adding a new book or editing
its info. 
Express.js is used for the server and mongoDB with Mongoose for the database. Used EJS as view
engine to create HTML templates. Used Express error handler to catch errors and display a EJS 
template which shows the error that has occured.
